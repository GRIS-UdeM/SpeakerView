# GodOSC
Implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol in Godot using GDScript and a group of nodes for convenient use. GodOSC receives and sends OSC messages over UDP. Currently supports OSC messages (but not bundles), floats, and integers.


# OSCServer
The OSCServer sets up a UDPServer to receive and parse OSC messages. These messages are stored in a Dictionary with the following convention:

{
"/example/address", [value1, value2, value]
}

OSCServer supports floats and ints.


# OSCClient
The OSCClient is used to send OSC messages to an OSC server, either in Godot or an outside program. OSCClients can only send to one server at a time but are able to send multiple messages to multiple addresses. Essentially you should have a 1:1 client-to-server ratio.


# OSCReceiver
A convenience node for controlling nodes with OSC messages. Attach an OSCReceiver to a node you'd like to manipulate and then *extend* the script on the OSCReceiver.
You can then manipulate the parent's properties.

IMPORTANT: You must check if the OSCServer has received a message on the address the OSCReciever is listening on. Here is some example code

if target_server.incoming_messages.has(osc_address):
>Do something with the incoming data


# OSCMessage
A convenience node for creating an OSC message. This can be placed anywhere within your scene but an OSCClient must be present to work. Again, make sure to *extend* the script on the OSC message to add your own code.
