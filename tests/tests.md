# SpeakerView Tests

## OSC Communication Test
This test is written in python and sends all the OSC messages that SpeakerView understands. It's not really a proper test with pass or fail but if you see the right output there's a good chance that everything is working fine.

### Installing the Eequirements

`pip install -f requirements.txt`

### Running the Test

Start SpeakerView from the binary or from Godot and then
